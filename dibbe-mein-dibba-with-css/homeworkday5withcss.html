            </section>
            <p style="font-size: x-large; margin-left: 18px;"> A day in my life starts with the boring morning of my alarm at 8:30 AM, though i keep 5-6 alarm in the morning still i dont wake up on time. followed by the chai cause i'm a chai‚òïÔ∏è person. I spend a few quiet moments stretching and scrolling through my phone, catching up on messages and the latest text by someone special. Once i'm fully awake, I dive into my morning routine ‚Äî a quick shower, a simple breakfast, and i start heading towards the college. My college begins around 10 AM, where i attend 3 lecture, someday lectures are super boring and someday they are very much interesting. My afternoons are also so boring after the lecture i head towards home and just have a afternoon nap. Around 5 PM, I wind down from sleep and shift gears maybe a walk outside, a workout session, or just relaxing with a my phone. I'm more a social media person. Evenings are very much interesting, a warm dinner, and finally a time with friends, and sometimes a movie or a bit of gaming. Before bed, I take time to think what should i wear next day in college(bohot kaam kapde hai bhai). Each day may not be wildly different, but in the quiet patterns of routine, there‚Äôs a kind of peace I‚Äôve grown to appreciate.

                        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;"> Photographyüì∏ </h1>
                        <p style="font-size: larger;">I personally love doing photography because it feels like a way to slow down time and truly see the world around me. There‚Äôs something incredibly fulfilling about capturing a moment‚Äîone that might otherwise pass unnoticed‚Äîand turning it into something lasting. Whether it‚Äôs the golden light just before sunset, a genuine smile on someone‚Äôs face, or the contrast of colors in a busy street, photography helps me appreciate those little things that make life beautiful. It‚Äôs not just about clicking pictures‚Äîit‚Äôs about observing, feeling, and connecting. When I have my camera with me, I find myself getting lost in the moment, forgetting everything else. It becomes more than a hobby; it‚Äôs a way to express how I see the world and how I feel about it. Photography gives me a sense of purpose, creativity, and peace, all at the same time.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: larger;">I personally love traveling because it opens up my world in the most unexpected and beautiful ways. Every trip is like a new chapter filled with fresh experiences, different cultures, and unforgettable memories. I love the feeling of stepping into a new place, not knowing exactly what to expect but being excited to explore. Whether it‚Äôs the calm of a quiet mountain village, the energy of a busy city, or the peaceful sound of waves crashing on a beach, traveling makes me feel alive and curious. It pushes me out of my comfort zone and helps me grow, not just as a person, but also in how I understand and connect with others. Meeting new people, trying different foods, hearing stories from locals‚Äîall of it makes the world feel both bigger and more connected. For me, traveling isn‚Äôt just about seeing places‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling them, living them, and carrying those moments with me long after the journey ends.</p>
